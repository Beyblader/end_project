          <h2>Future Technology</h2>
           
            <h4>1.Mercedes-Benz Vision AVTR</h4>
        
            <img src="https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/innovation/concept-cars/vision-avtr/_jcr_content/root/paragraph/paragraph-right/paragraphimage/image/MQ6-10-image-20200107143530/02-mercedes-benz-vehicles-concept-cars-vision-avtr-3400x1440.jpeg" width="300px">
            <p>With its four high-performance and near-wheel-built electric motors, the VISION AVTR embodies a particularly agile implementation of the vision of a dynamic luxury saloon. With a combined engine power of more than 350 kW, the VISION AVTR sets a new benchmark for EQ Power. Thanks to the intelligent and fully variable torque distribution, the power of the four fully individually controllable motors is not only managed in the best possible way in terms of driving dynamics, but above all in a highly efficient manner.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>2.Mercedes-Benz Vision EQS</h4>
        
            <img src="https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/innovation/concept-cars/vision-eqs/_jcr_content/image/MQ6-12-image-20190910094823/00-mercedes-benz-vision-eqs-show-car-mercedes-benz-eq-2560x1440.jpeg" width="300px">
            <p>The VISION EQS is a first milestone on the way to a CO₂-neutral mobility of the future. Mercedes-Benz has always stood for technical innovation, responsibility and fascination. And sustainability is now another integral component of the brand philosophy. The show car already meets these aspirations today, and gives an outlook on the future large, electric saloons by the brand. With its innovative, stretched “one bow” design, the VISION EQS takes the Progressive Luxury design philosophy of the EQ models by Mercedes-Benz into a new dimension. The “seamless” look of this dramatic and powerful sculpture is what gives the VISION EQS its majestic presence.</p>

            <h4>3.Lexus LF-30 Electrified</h4>
        
            <img src="https://www.lexus.co.id/content/dam/lexus-v3-blueprint/discover-lexus/future-and-concept-cars/lf-30/lexus-lf30-ext-01-d.jpg" width="300px">
            <p>It took two months of intense discussions to define our vision for the groundbreaking LF-30. Our engineers and designers worked on a new concept with this vehicle – a seamless merger of performance, comfort, and technology.
                By surpassing barriers, we have crafted a provocative electric vehicle with space-age lines and avant-garde engineering. We looked to the future for inspiration, and we now present to you an innovative vehicle of tomorrow – the LF-30 Electrified.</p>
                <br>
            <h4>4.Tesla Cybertruck</h4>
        
            <img src="https://akcdn.detik.net.id/visual/2021/08/10/tesla-cybertruck-4_169.jpeg?w=650" width="300px">
            <p>The new Tesla Cybertruck will come with new megawatt charging compatibility. This technology has been developed for the new Tesla Semi HGV and will be made available to Cybertruck drivers, confirmed Tesla CEO Elon Musk. It’s rumoured that you might see a production version of the Cybertruck revealed at the Tesla investors day on March 1st. The first lucky customers might get their hands on this high-tech slice of electric pickup pie before 2024.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>5.Lexus LF-Z Electrified</h4>
        
            <img src="https://www.lexus.co.id/content/dam/lexus-v3-blueprint/motorshow/2021/lf-z-electrified-concept/performance/gallery/Mar30_LEX-LFZ-CY21-0048-d.jpg" width="300px">
            <p>The LF-Z Electrified Concept is the first Lexus to be built on our all-new, all-electric platform. With a predicted 600 km range, this crossover can accelerate to 100 kph in just 3 seconds.
                Brimming with visionary innovation, this vehicle uses Direct4 technology, steer-by-wire, and an advanced AI that partners with you on your journey. This is what the future feels like – and the feeling is electric.</p>
                <br>
            <h4>6.Kawasaki J</h4>
        
            <img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xQEEzbqpJVs/WmHpJ7bd1MI/AAAAAAAAGfQ/E3-gzo1tXVU6U3Fuf50FMz3R_xmmLS4BgCLcBGAs/s1600/Kawasaki%2BConcept%2BJ%2B%2528electric%2Bthree%2Bwheeler%2529%2Bvideo%2Breleased.jpg" width="300px">
            <p>Kawasaki J concept is a three wheeled vehicle, a cross between a motorcycle and a tricycle. In Comfort Mode the two front wheels are spread apart and the J has a raised stance, providing a more comfortable position to the rider. Sport Mode, ideal for high speeds, brings the front wheels closer together and the bike lowers itself for a lower center of gravity. In this mode the rider becomes one with the machine, making for a more aerodynamic unit.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>7.Honda V4 Concept</h4>
        
            <img src="https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/4Honda-V4-Concept1.jpg" width="300px">
            <p>If you thought the Kawasaki J dating back to 2013 was a throwback, just check out Honda’s 2008 V4 Concept.

                Based on the brand’s trademark V4 engines, the concept challenged all motorbike design conventions at the time.
                
                Its hubless sawblade wheels were the most futuristic of all design elements.
                
                But the fact they are fixed in place and can’t rotate appears to be a bit of an oversight.
                
                Consider the V4 Concept simply a case of style over substance.</p>
                <br>
            <h4>8.BMW Motorrad & LEGO Technic Hover Ride</h4>
        
            <img src="https://da4dkroembtou.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/P90248860_highRes_lego-technic-design-.jpg" width="300px">
            <p>When BMW and LEGO Technic teamed up to make a kit to build the R 1200 GS Adventure, the two designed the kit to also make a hoverbike concept with the same pieces.

                Dubbed the Hover Ride, the two decided to take it a step further by building a real-life replica of the bike.
                
                The bike is powered by a fuel cell/battery hybrid system housed inside a casing resembling a BMW flat-twin engine.
                
                To stay afloat, it uses a propeller at the rear and an anti-gravity thruster system.
                
             </p>
             <br>
            <h4>9.Arc Vector </h4>
        
            <img src="https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/8-Arc-Vector2-1024x640.jpg" width="300px">
            <p>The Arc Vector has been a will-they, wont-they startup for a few years.

                But it is finally edging closer to production.
                
                The Vector is set to be handmade and personalized for each owner, but that’s hardly the impressive bit.
                
                What’s most impressive is that it offers 436km (271mi) of range. That’s more than double the J1, and nearly double the Harley-Davidson LiveWire.
                
                It can also be charged in just 40 minutes, making long-distance electric touring a real possibility.
                
             </p>
             <br>
             <h4>10.IBM Watson</h4>
         
             <img src="https://internetofbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ibm-watson3.jpg" width="300px">
             <p>Watson advances trust from principle to practice. Transparent processes provide insight into AI-led decisions. We enable data privacy, compliance and security across highly regulated industries, and support an open, diverse ecosystem driving responsible use of AI.</p>
             <br>
             <h4>11.AlphaGo</h4>
         
             <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQDnZeAjE_V8pPVWC9lCH5Cod25cIy59mNEua759OrmAjvcGsY5Q316QrLJRviPHZmqYHg&usqp=CAU" width="300px">
             <p>Two players, using either white or black stones, take turns placing their stones on a board. The goal is to surround and capture their opponent's stones or strategically create spaces of territory. Once all possible moves have been played, both the stones on the board and the empty points are tallied. The highest number wins.

                As simple as the rules may seem, Go is profoundly complex. There are an astonishing 10 to the power of 170 possible board configurations - more than the number of atoms in the known universe.</p>
             <br>
             <h4>12.Siri</h4>
         
             <img src="https://cdn2.downdetector.com/static/uploads/logo/Siri.png" width="300px">
             <p>Siri keeps your information private and secure — what you ask Siri isn’t associated with your Apple ID. The power of the Apple Neural Engine ensures that the audio of your requests never leaves your iPhone or iPad unless you choose to share it. On-device intelligence makes your experience with Siri personal — learning your preferences and what you might want — while maintaining your privacy. And, of course, what you share with Siri is never shared with advertisers.</p>
             <br>
             <br>
             <h4>13.Cortana</h4>
         
             <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Microsoft_Cortana_transparent.svg/1200px-Microsoft_Cortana_transparent.svg.png" width="300px">
             <p>Another AI app that hardly needs an introduction is Cortana, the virtual assistant from Microsoft. This AI-powered virtual assistant is available on Windows 10, Windows Mobile, Invoke smart speaker, Microsoft Band, Android, iOS, Windows Mixed Reality (MR), Amazon Alexa, and Xbox One. Cortana offers hands-free help, answers questions, provides reminders, keeps notes, takes care of tasks, and helps in managing the calendar. Over time, Cortana “learns” and attends to more complex tasks.</p>
